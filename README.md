# gcloudrig

A collection of bash scripts that use [Google's Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) to create and maintain a cloud gaming instance, on the cheap.

Requires `bash`, `gcloud` and `python2.7.x` (required by `gcloud`); or just use [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/).

## Prerequisites
-  bash
-  python 2.7.x
-  [gcloud sdk](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install)

- [ZeroTier](https://zerotier.com/)
- [TightVNC Client](https://www.tightvnc.com/)
- [Parsec](https://parsecgaming.com/)

### Specs
-  8 vCPU (n1-standard-8)
-  NVIDIA Tesla P4 (nvidia-tesla-p4-vws)
-  50GB SSD (pd-ssd)
-  500GB Storage (pd-standard)
-  Windows Server 2016 (windows-2016)

*Cloud responsibly. These scripts are provided as-is, with zero support. At the very least, create a new GCP project.*

## One-time setup
-  [Start Cloud Shell in a new project](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/starting-cloud-shell), and/or run locally
-  Clone this repository
   ````
   $ git clone "https://github.com/putty182/gcloudrig"
   ````
-  Run `setup.sh`.  If you don't say yes to install software see the [Manual method](#manual-software-install) below.
   ````
   $ cd "gcloudrig"
   $ ./setup.sh
   ````
-  If anything goes wrong during setup, start over with these commands
   ````
   $ ./destroy.sh
   $ ./setup.sh
   ````
- Run `./scale-up.sh` to start your instance.
  - If you answered Yes to installing software during setup.sh:
    that will happen during the first start and will take around 10-20mins for that to finish.
    - You can track progress with the [Log Viewer](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer?resource=global&minLogLevel=200).
    - Once the install is complete, [configure the installed software](#configure-software)
  - If you answered No to installing software during setup.sh:
    the instance will be empty
    - Run `./reset-windows-password.sh` to get the IP, Username and Password you'll need to RDP to your instance and start installing software.
      Alternatively, see [Creating Passwords for Windows Instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/windows/creating-passwords-for-windows-instances)
    - follow [Manual Software Install](#manual-software-install)

- Connect to your instance with RDP
  - Visit [Compute Engine > VM Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances):
    - click the "RDP" button to open the Chrome RDP client
    - OR download an RDP file to use with a local RDP client
    See [Connecting to Windows Instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance#windows) for more info.

### Manual Software Install

If you selected 'No' to automatically install software during setup follow these steps to get a stable "gaming" setup:

- Install [GRIDÂ® drivers for virtual workstations](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/add-gpus#installing_gridwzxhzdk37_drivers_for_virtual_workstations)
- Install [Virtual Audio Cable](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/)
- Setup [Autologon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/sysinternals/downloads/autologon) to avoid a login screen at boot
- Install [ZeroTier](https://zerotier.com/)
- Install [TightVNC Server](https://www.tightvnc.com/)
- Reboot to finish GPU driver installation.
- Login with TightVNC, set display to "Show only on Monitor 2" and give it an appropriate screen resolution.  This will disable the primary 640x480 virtual screen, which can't be resized and gives Parsec headaches when games try to launch on it.
- Attempt to change the volume; Windows should prompt that the Windows Sound service isn't running.  Start it.  Alternatviely, run `services.msc` and change it's startup options there.
- Install [Parsec](https://parsecgaming.com/)
- Install game clients (e.g. Steam, Battlenet)

next [configure the software](#configure-software)

### Configure Software 

- Configure ZeroTier
  1. create/join a network 
  1. set it to run on boot by right-clicking it's icon in the System Tray
- Configure TightVNC
  1. lock it down to your Zerotier network IP range (e.g. `allow 10.147.17.0-10.147.17.255`; `deny 0.0.0.0-255.255.255`).
  1. Test a VNC connection using your instance's ZeroTier IP now.
- Login and configure Parsec
  1. save login details
  1. enable hosting
  1. [configure Parsec to only listen on the ZeroTier IP](https://support.parsecgaming.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002766652-Setting-Up-A-VPN-To-Play-Games-On-A-Virtual-Local-Network)
  1. set it to run on boot by right-clicking it's icon in the system Tray
- Login to Steam/Battlenet
  1. install a game or two.
- (Optional) Signup at [Duck DNS](https://www.duckdns.org/)
  - create a hostname for the private ZeroTier IP (NOT the public one). 
  - If you really want a hostname for the dynamic public IP as well, create a secondary hostname and pick your favourite set of installation instructions.
- (Optional) Secure RDP
  1. Edit `default-allow-rdp` firewall rule in Cloud Console
  1. change it's `Targets` to `Specified target tags` and add a target tag of `rdp-server`
     so only instances with the network tag `rdp-server` have public RDP ports.
  1. If you really need to RDP into the public IP address, add this network tag to a running instance.

## Starting your rig
- Run `./scale-up.sh` to start your instance.

## Stopping your rig
- Run `./scale-down.sh` to shutdown your instance.

  Once stopped, it will take a few minutes to create a copy of both boot and
  games disks.  Read [Disk maintenance](#disk-maintenance) below for more info.

## Notes
Avoid using RDP since it'll disconnect your "physical" session on the virtual monitor.  Doing so will show the windows lock screen on the virtual monitor, which upsets most streaming clients.  If you find yourself in this situation, connect using VNC to fix the issue or just use RDP anyway and restart the instance.

Whenever connecting to your instance, you should always use the ZeroTier IP. Only open up your instance's Public IP if that few extra milliseconds of software networking lag is worth foregoing basic network security.

## Disk Maintenance

TODO

## Travelling?
gcloudrig keeps your rig as a boot image and disk snapshot, both of which are globally available in GCE.

To run your rig in a different part of the world, just run `./change-region.sh` to change your default region, then run `./scale-up.sh`.
